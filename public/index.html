        <h2 slot="title">Viticulture Played</h2>
        <p slot="message">I've heard a lot of great things about Viticulture and got the game last December. This past week I finally got it to the table!</p>

          <h2>Viticulture Played</h2>
          <span class="align-right">By: Alex Lockhart</span>
          <h3>Initial Impression</h3>
          <p>The game looks amazing and the component quality is stunning. While the setup was simple it took a while for us to wrap our heads around how the vines create grapes, grapes are turned into wine and wine is sold to orders. However once we started to see that flow of the mechanics we really started to see how we could build up our vinyard to sell the most wine.</p>
          <h3>Opinion on the Game</h3>
          <p>So far I have played four games of Viticulture and am loving it. The subtle strategies and techniques in each stage of the wine making process, the different areas of focus, and the evolving experience from early, mid to late game come together for a great game. We'll see how I enjoy the game through more playthroughs, but so far this is one of my top games.</p>

          <h2>What is the Newark Gaming Group?</h2>
          <p>Currently, as of this writing, we play board games the second Saturday of every month at 4pm. This may change as time goes on. You will be able to find the latest news here, along with announcements of game days and game nights.</p>
          <p>But really, I wanted to make a website and needed something simple to do. So a simple news feed about our board game days was something simple to do.</p>
